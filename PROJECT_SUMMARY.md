## 🚫 Limitations

⚠️ **Real-time prices**: Agent doesn't have live prices - cross-check with Kite
⚠️ **Predictive accuracy**: Market surprises happen - use as framework, not gospel
⚠️ **Historical limits**: Analysis limited to public information availability
⚠️ **No guarantees**: Markets are uncertain - recommendations are views, not promises

---

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **Provide Complete Data**: Include all purchase details for accuracy
2. **Verify Recommendations**: Cross-check with current market data
3. **Use as Framework**: Don't blindly follow - use for decision-making framework
4. **Regular Updates**: Request analysis updates as market changes
5. **Portfolio Context**: Share full portfolio for better allocation suggestions
6. **Risk Awareness**: Understand you make final investment decisions

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Agent says can't fetch prices"**
→ Normal. Verify with Kite terminal for current prices.

**"Analysis seems generic"**
→ Provide more specifics: exact tickers, dates, your goals, risk tolerance.

**"Recommendation conflicts my view"**
→ Ask agent to analyze your specific concern. Make final call yourself.

### Getting Better Responses

- ✅ Be specific (dates, amounts, tickers)
- ✅ Provide context (timeline, risk tolerance, goal)
- ✅ Ask follow-ups (ask for targets, risks, alternatives)
- ✅ Request web search (for latest news, verification)
