## Agent Behavior Details

### What The Agent Does Well

✅ Analyzes stock purchase vs. current price  
✅ Provides 5-year historical performance context  
✅ Searches web for latest news and company updates  
✅ Gives bold, professional financial recommendations  
✅ Distinguishes between short-term (3-6 month) and long-term (1-5 year) strategies  
✅ Considers Indian and global market context  
✅ Calculates gains/losses from purchase date  
✅ Identifies support/resistance and technical levels  

### Limitations

⚠️ Data is as current as the agent's knowledge cutoff + web searches  
⚠️ Not real-time pricing (recommend cross-checking with Kite/NSE)  
⚠️ Historical analysis limited to publicly available information  
⚠️ Recommendations are based on technical and fundamental analysis, not trading signals  
⚠️ Always verify recommendations with current market data before executing trades  

---

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Complete Data**: Include purchase dates and prices for accurate analysis
2. **Be Specific**: Ask about specific stocks or scenarios rather than vague questions
3. **Trust but Verify**: Cross-check recommendations with current market data
4. **Understand Your Risk**: The agent provides analysis, but you make final decisions
5. **Regular Updates**: Request analysis updates as market conditions change
6. **Portfolio Perspective**: Share your entire portfolio for better allocation recommendations

---

## Creating Additional Agents

To create more custom agents:

1. Create a new `.agent.md` file in the `.copilot/` directory
2. Add YAML frontmatter with agent configuration
3. Write detailed instructions for the agent's behavior
4. Reference the [GitHub Custom Agents Configuration Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-agents-configuration)

## Notes

- Agents use the latest available model in your environment
- Web search capability requires internet connectivity
- Market data comes from public sources and web searches
- For real-time Kite data integration, you may want to set up MCP servers
